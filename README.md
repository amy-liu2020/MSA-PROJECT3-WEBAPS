**Target persona:**

**App Targets**

·   Girls like Andie are experiencing culture shock, she has problems that she cannot tell her friends and she is welling for changes.

·   This app appears as a platform for all Chinese girls in Melbourne to communicate. People like Andie can share their problems on our ‘Girl Talks’ Forum, everyone can see and provide a feedback or encouragement for her.

·   This app also is used to publish articles that relates to Chinese international students and feminism. Through reading these articles, girls like Andie may be able to understand Australian girls better. She can even find a way to make some changes, to step forwards, to shape the girl she want to be.

 

**Extensibility:**

·   This app is to Chinese female international students only. However, it can be extended to be a platform for all international students, or further to be a platform to connect both international and domestic student.

·   The forum structure can be upgraded in the future. The import problems can be submitted anonymously.

·   Online chat room can also be added. Girls can join the main chat room, and they can also create small chat room to share it with friends, or people with the same interests. For example, they can create a piano chat room for all the girls are interested in piano.

·   Instead of articles, we can also share videos, webinars, talks from experts and researchers.
